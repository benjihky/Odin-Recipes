    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork loin chops (boneless)</li>
        <li>Neutral oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Tonkatsu Breading</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Panko <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/panko/">(Japanese breadcumbs)</a></li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>With a sharp knife, remove the extra fat and make several slits on the connective tissue (white area) between the meat and fat. The reason why you do this is that red meat and fat have a different elasticity, and when they are cooked, they will shrink and expand at different rates. This will allow Tonkatsu to stay nice and flat when deep frying and prevent it from curling up.</li>
        <li>Flip the meat and make several slits on the other side of the connective tissue.</li>
        <li>Pound both sides of the meat with the back of a knife or a meat tenderizer/pounder.</li>
        <li>Mold the meat back into its original shape with your hands.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the meat with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Crack the egg in a deep dish and add oil. Whisk together until well combined. By adding oil, the meat and breading won’t detach from each other while deep frying and the juice and flavor from the meat will not escape easily. Prepare a deep dish for flour, too.</li>
        <li>Dredge the pork in flour and dust off any excess flour. Excess flour will create a coating that prevents the egg mixture from latching onto the pork. Then dip the pork in the egg mixture and coat nicely.</li>
        <li>Dredge the pork in panko and remove excess panko while pressing down the panko gently. While deep frying, panko will “pop up” so at this moment they don’t have to be fluffy. Set aside for 5-10 minutes so the meat and breading will be set.</li>
        <li>Add oil to the pot and bring it to 340ºF (170ºC) over medium heat. If you don’t have a thermometer, stick a chopstick in the oil and see if tiny bubbles start to appear around the tip of the chopstick. Alternatively, you can drop one piece of panko into the oil, and if it sinks down to the middle of oil and immediately comes right up, then the oil is ready.</li>
        <li>Gently put one pork into the oil and cook for 1 minute (without flipping). Don't touch the pork for 30 seconds. Why one piece? You don't want to reduce the oil temperature drastically. The size of the bubbles should be big when you add the pork. Keep watching the oil temperature and make sure it doesn’t go over 340ºF (170ºC) or else the panko gets too dark and the pork is undercook.</li>
        <li>After a minute, flip the pork and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Take out the pork and remove excess oil by holding it vertically for a few seconds. Place on the wire rack or paper towel and let it sit for 4 minutes. The hot oil on the exterior is slowly cooking the meat as it sits.</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes, the pork should be ready for the second frying. Bring the oil to 355ºF (180ºC) and fry the pork for 30 seconds on each side.</li>
        <li>Continue with the second piece of the pork. Drain the oil on the wire rack/paper towel for 2 minutes in a vertical position so the panko does not get soggy on one side.</li>
        <li>Cut the tonkatsu into ¾ inch (2 cm) wide pieces.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate and serve it with the shredded cabbage and sesame dressing and the sesame tonkatsu sauce you've prepared.</li>
